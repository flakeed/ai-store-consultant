## Project name: ai-store-consultant

### Description:

The "ai-store-consultant" project was developed as part of a university practice and represents an advanced solution for improving the shopping experience. Based on artificial intelligence technologies and GPT-4 algorithms, this assistant helps customers choose the perfect products, providing personalized recommendations based on their needs and preferences.

In the process of interacting with "ai-store-consultant", users can conveniently add selected products to a virtual cart. This functionality not only simplifies the selection process, but also allows customers to review their selections, make changes or make purchasing decisions at any time without rushing.

When the user is ready to place an order, the system generates a unique order number after confirming the selection of items in the cart. This number can then be presented to the seller, which allows him to quickly find the prepared order in the system and issue it after full payment. Thus, "ai-store-consultant" minimizes waiting time and makes the purchasing process more comfortable and organized for the client.

The project aims to improve retail by creating more personal, convenient and efficient shopping experiences, offering a modern approach to retail and increasing customer satisfaction.
